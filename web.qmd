The present website is static and lightweight for the community to update it easily and with little institutional constraints. It is built from Quarto *qmd* files from within Posit/RStudio, all available on Github, and its \_site part ftp'd to [ectqg.org](ectqg.org) . Don't hesitate to suggest improvements or raise any issue at <https://github.com/geocaruso/ectqg>
